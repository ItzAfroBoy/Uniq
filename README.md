# Uniq

## What is Uniq  

Uniq is an application using a node package named `Nativefier`.  
It allows you to use your favourite websites like `Youtube` and `Facebook` as `Native Apps` on your system (`.exe`).  
What the batch file does is to make this process easier than forever typing the commands.

## Installation

To install `Uniq`, the following is required:

- MacOS 10.9 or later / Windows (7 or later recommended) / Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS recommended)
- Node.js >=6 (10.16.0 LTS recommended)

**Note:**

``` plain text
It is best to create applications for your own OS for easy use. Windows is currently the only supported OS as the script is written in batch. It is currently be reworked to work universally in the most efficient way
```

## Usage

When the batch file is ran, a menu with options appears:

1. Convert a website
2. Install requirements (`Nativefier`)
3. Check to see if `Nativefier` is installed
4. Exit the applicantion / batch file

``` Markdown
When converting a website and you are asked to enter a url,
remember to include a domain e.g.
- .com

- .io

You should also include the protocol to access the web address e.g.
- https
