# Uniq

## What is Uniq  

Uniq is an application using a node package named `Nativefier`.  
It allows you to use your favourite websites like `Youtube` and `Facebook` as `Native Apps` on your system (`.exe`).  
What the batch file does is to make this process easier than forever typing the commands.

### What the Batch File contains

When the batch file is ran, a menu with options appears to

1. Convert a website
2. Install requirements (`Nativefier`)
3. Check to see if `Nativefier` is installed
4. Come to this Github repo
5. Clone the Github repo
6. Exit the applicantion / batch file

This makes using `Nativefier` easier for beginners on using the command line

## Installation

To install `Uniq`, the following is required:

- MacOS 10.9 or later / Windows (7 or later recommended) / Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS recommended)

## Usage

``` Markdown
